This directory holds all the the apps visual components such as buttons and dropdowns. It contains all of the front end of the app. In addition, callbacks are specified inside certain components for executing backend operations based on user input, such as changing the data selected for when using the calendar component. 

The entire UI is constructed in layout.py in the create_layout() function by bringing together the components and any additional formatting such as line breaks in an html div. The div is then given to app.layout in main.py to be displayed.
